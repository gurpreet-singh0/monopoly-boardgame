<h1>Monopoly - Board Game</h1>
<h3> History of the Game</h3>
<p style="margin-top:10px;">
    The history of Monopoly can be traced back to 1903,when American anti-monopolist Lizzie Magie created a game that she hoped would explain the 
    single-tax theory of Henry George. It was intended as an educational tool,
     to illustrate the negative aspects of concentrating land-in private monopolies. She took out a patent in 1904. Her game, 
     The Landlord's Game, was self-published, beginning in 1906.<br>
Magie created two sets of rules: an anti-monopolist set in which all were rewarded when wealth was created, and a monopolist set in which the goal was to create monopolies and crush opponents.

            <h1 style="padding-top: 40px;">Top 3 Strategies for Winning</h1>
            <h4>1. Start strong</h4>
            <p>A big mistake people often make is avoiding smaller properties.
                 Instead, they save their money for the more expensive options further around the Monopoly board.
                A slow and steady approach will often cost you the game, so don’t save money. Instead, invest your money early and reap the rewards later in the game.</p>
    
                <h4>2. Buy red and orange</h4>
                <p> It’s a good idea to snap up these properties as early as possible. Doing so means you collect more rent and increase your chances of winning.</p>

                    <h4>3. Three houses are better than one</h4>
                    <p>

                        Make it your number one priority to get three houses on your monopolies.
                        
                        The price difference between one and three houses is huge. Having three houses will punish a player who lands there and increase your overall income, increasing your chances of winning the game.
