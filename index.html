<h1>Monopoly - Board Game</h1>
<p>
    Monopoly is a multi-player economics-themed board game. 
    In the game, players roll two dice to move around the game board, buying and trading properties and
     developing them with houses and hotels. 
    Players collect rent from their opponents and aim to drive them into bankruptcy. 
  Monopoly has become a part of international popular culture, having been licensed 
     locally in more than 103 countries and printed in more than 37 languages. <br>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">How to play </h1>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Starting with the Banker, each player throws the dice. The player with the highest total starts the play.

    Then each player places his token on the corner marked "GO", and throw the dice and move his the number of spaces indicated by the dice.
    
    The tokens remain on the spaces occupied and proceed from that point on the player's next turn.
    
    Two or more tokens may rest on the same space at the same time.
    
    If one or both dice roll off the board, or land on or lean against a card deck, the roll is invalid. Roll them again.
