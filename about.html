    <h1>About Myself</h1>
   <p> Hi, I'm Gurpreet Singh, an Indian student currently enrolled in Seneca College's Computer Programming course in Toronto, Canada. As someone who's passionate about programming and game development, I decided to create a website of Monopoly for a project in my CPP course.</p>
<br>
<p>I chose Monopoly because it's a classic board game that's been played for generations, and it's also been adapted into various digital forms. The game involves strategy, negotiation, and decision-making, which I found intriguing. Additionally, I found the history and evolution of Monopoly interesting, from its creation during the Great Depression to its current worldwide popularity.</p>
<br>

<p>To create my digital version of Monopoly, I researched the game's rules, history, and strategies using resources like Wikipedia. I also drew inspiration from other digital versions of Monopoly and incorporated my own creative ideas to make my site unique.</p>
