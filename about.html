    <h1>About Myself</h1>
   <p> Hi, I'm Gurpreet Singh, an Indian student currently enrolled in Seneca College's Computer Programming course in Toronto, Canada. As someone who's passionate about programming and game development, I decided to create a website of Monopoly for a project in my CPP course.</p>
<br>
<p>I chose Monopoly because it's a classic board game that's been played for generations, and it's also been adapted into various digital forms. The game involves strategy, negotiation, and decision-making, which I found intriguing. Additionally, I found the history and evolution of Monopoly interesting, from its creation during the Great Depression to its current worldwide popularity.</p>
<br>

<p>To create my digital version of Monopoly, I researched the game's rules, history, and strategies using resources like Wikipedia. I also drew inspiration from other digital versions of Monopoly and incorporated my own creative ideas to make my site unique.</p>
<br>
<p>Honesty Statement: <br>
    I declare that my assessment is wholly my own work in accordance with Seneca Academic Policy. No part of this assessment has been copied manually or electronically from any other source (including web sites) except for the information supplied by the WEB222 instructors and / or made available in this assessment for my use. I also declare that no part of this assignment has been distributed to other students.</p><br>
